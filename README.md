## Data Visualization Projects - Visualize Data with a Bar Chart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-heat-map.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-bar-chart)

The site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-bar-chart/.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-bar-chart/?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses D3 to create a bar chart of GDP data from 1946 to 2015.  Though this chart
technically has bars in order the pass the freeCodeCamp test suite, it is actually displayed as an area graph here (with the bars actually making up the area). 
Additionally, this project also demonstrates the use of React, ESLint, and a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis with deployment to GitHub pages.

The project requirements can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart.
